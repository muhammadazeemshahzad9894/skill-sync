Test Case 1 – Backend Service with Database and Containers

This project focuses on building a backend service that uses PostgreSQL for data storage. The application is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and runs inside Docker containers. The setup highlights containerized deployment, cloud infrastructure usage, and relational database integration.

Test Case 2 – .NET Ecosystem Web Platform

This project is a web platform built using ASP.NET Core and VB.NET. Application data is stored in Microsoft SQL Server. The project demonstrates integration within the .NET ecosystem, combining modern ASP.NET Core components with existing VB.NET codebases.

Test Case 3 — Data Engineering & Big Data Pipeline

This project focuses on building a scalable data processing pipeline for large-scale analytics. The system ingests streaming and batch data using Apache Kafka and processes it with Apache Spark. Analytical workloads are executed using Databricks SQL to support efficient querying and reporting. The solution is designed to handle high data volumes and support modern data engineering workflows.

Test Case 4 — Machine Learning Platform

This project is centered on training and deploying machine learning models. Development is carried out using PyTorch and Scikit-Learn for model experimentation, training, and evaluation. Once trained, models are deployed to Google Cloud to enable scalable inference and cloud-based integration. The project emphasizes modern ML practices and cloud deployment.

Test Case 5 — Mobile Game Development

This project involves developing a cross-platform mobile game. React Native is used for mobile application development, while Unity is used for game engine and 3D rendering capabilities. Android Studio and Maven are used as the primary development and build tools. The project highlights the separation between development skills and supporting tooling.

Test Case 6 — Multi-Cloud Data Storage System

This project implements a multi-cloud architecture for data storage and service deployment. Application data is stored across Cloud Firestore and Azure Cosmos DB to ensure flexibility and redundancy. Services are deployed on both Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, demonstrating cross-cloud compatibility and vendor-agnostic system design.

Test Case 7 — Legacy and Modern .NET Integration

This project focuses on maintaining an existing legacy system while gradually introducing modern services. The legacy components are built using the .NET Framework, while new services are developed using modern .NET (5+). Data persistence relies on Microsoft Access. The project demonstrates coexistence and migration strategies between legacy and modern .NET technologies.

Test Case 8 — C / C++ Toolchain Project

This project involves low-level software development using C and C++. The compilation and testing workflow is handled using industry-standard tools such as GCC, Clang, and Google Test. The focus is on proper toolchain usage, compiler selection, and automated testing in native development environments.

Test Case 9 — Backend API with Messaging and Cloud

This project focuses on building a backend API using the Spring Framework. The system communicates asynchronously using Apache Kafka and is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture demonstrates integration between backend frameworks, cloud infrastructure, and distributed messaging systems.

Test Case 10 —  Research and Notebook-Driven Workflow

This project is research-oriented and focuses on experimentation rather than production systems. Development and analysis are primarily performed using Jupyter Notebooks with Python. The workflow supports rapid prototyping, data exploration, and experimentation in an interactive environment.
