I’d describe my natural team role as a Implementer: I’m practical and like turning ideas into concrete steps. I like a balance of async messages and live discussions, depending on the task. How strict I am with deadlines depends on the impact and the current workload. In conflicts I often act as a mediator and try to understand all sides. I enjoy collaborating on direction instead of having a single strong leader.\nProfessionalTech: DevOps function;Automated testing;Knowledge sharing community;Continuous integration (CI) and (more often) continuous delivery\nProfessionalCloud: Hybrid (on-prem and cloud)"
